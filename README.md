# SQLiteExplorer

It is a quick&dirty SQLite database file explorer, also capable of opening encrypted database files.  
It was created essentially as a debug tool, not as a production project, so it is reasonable to be a bit rough around the edges.

**Features**  
-Encrypted file support  
-View content and schema information  
-Execute arbitrary SQL statements  
-Automatically detect blob fields and only show the first few characters  
-Copy cell contents as-shown and base64 decoded
